Why read this guide? : Your curious or wish to build an app for Tercen then this is the guide. Motivation: Tercen promotes collaboration for data analysis. Not everyone can code or even wants to, but everyone should benefit from the explosion of data and code currently taking place. Tercen allows non programmers (e.g. biologists) to explore their data and allows programmers (e.g. bioinformaticians) to upload their code (or web-apps) for the biologist to use. By offering this services we believe biologist get empowered and can claim back control of their data. The bioinformatician gets liberated from the operational details and day to day analysis demands from the biologist. This is summed up with the phrase: "],

We will analyse data from the TARA Oceans project, coming from this publication: Guidi et al. (2016): Guidi, L., Chaffron, S., Bittner, L., Eveillard, D., Larhlimi, A., Roux, S., … &amp; Coelho, L. P. (2016). Plankton networks driving carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. Nature, 532(7600), 465-470. Our goal is to look at how eukaryotic plankton lineages are associated to environmental parameters such as carbon export. To do so, we will: create a new project in Tercen upload the dataset containing the correlation of different lineages to environmental parameters create a heatmap representing this correlation 1.1 Creating a Tercen project First, we will create a Tercen project for our analyses. Start Tercen and log in Click on New project Assign the team of your choice to the project Give a name and description to this project, then click on OK Your project is now created ! 1.2 Loading data into Tercen We will use data from Guidi et al. (2016), more specifically the Supplementary Table 5. 1. Download the data onto your computer You can find the data here: https://github.com/tercen/tara_gorsky2016_data. In this tutorial, we will just use the SI5_eukaryotic_lineages.tsv file. 2. Go back to Tercen and load the data Now that we have the data on our computer, we can import it into Tercen. Go to the newly created project Click on New data set Upload the SI5_eukaryotic_lineages.tsv file (1) Give a name to the data set (2) Click on Next (3) Check that the data set has been loaded properly and click on Next Give a name to the values (here, measurement) and variables (here, environmental_variable) (1) Check all the variables (2) Uncheck the ones that are not part of the environmental parameters of interest (here, Latitude and Longitude) (3) and click on OK The data set is now uploaded to Tercen! 1.3 Creating a workflow Now that we have created our dataset, we will create a workflow to analyse and visualise it. Click on New workflow Give a name to your workflow Your workflow appears now in your project. Click on it Your are now on the workflow environment that is empty. We will now add the data set we uploaded before. Right click anywhere in the blank area and click on Add. Select Table and click on OK. Select the data set and click on OK. Now the data set is ready to be used ! 1.3.1 Making a heatmap To analyse our data we need to: 1. Add a data step to the workflow Right click on the data set and select Add Select Data step 2. Make the heatmap projection Double click on the newly created data step Drag and drop elements to make the heatmap projection as in the following video: We now have our first heatmap, our data projection should look like this: 3. Improve the heatmap by ordering rows and columns and adding dendrograms This heatmap looks nice, but it would be better if we could order rows and columns and add dendrograms! That way we could see which species and environmental parameters cluster together. Tercen includes a heatmap operator (called Shiny Heatmap) to make such a representation. In the sidebar, click on the plus sign to add an operator (1) Pick the shiny_heatmap_operator. It appears now the data step environment (2) Then click on Operator view tab on the left to see the result (3) Et voilà! The operator view appeared, as well as our heatmap with a dendrogram: "],
