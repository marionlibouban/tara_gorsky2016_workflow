# Introduction

## Goals {-}

Tercen is inspired by the Tara Ocean Foundation. Tara oceanic expeditions aim is to study and understand the impact of climate change and the ecological crisis facing the world's oceans. Tara datasets and analysis are made open simple and accessible to the community!

You can use the rapid, flexible and interactive features of Tercen. Now go to the tercen open project to browse and interact with a tara dataset for plankton carbon emission.

## Data and methods {-}

The data comes from the TARA Oceans project, coming from this publication: [Guidi et al. (2016)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4851848/):

> Guidi, L., Chaffron, S., Bittner, L., Eveillard, D., Larhlimi, A., Roux, S., ... & Coelho, L. P. (2016). Plankton networks driving carbon export in the oligotrophic ocean. Nature, 532(7600), 465-470.
